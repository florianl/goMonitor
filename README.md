goMonitor
=========

This is `goMonitor` and it is written in [golang](https://golang.org/).
`goMonitor` is some kind of a bot. Every five minutes it sends a ping to hosts
and reports failures via the [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api?filter-product=sms)-API.
It can be run as a micro instance on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/compute/).
